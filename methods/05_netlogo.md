## Lesson objective:
###Preequisite
Students have already learned program diagramming.

### Aim:  
Implement a sierpinski triangle with netLogo

### Warm up
time: 9
Play gif/video of sierpinski triangle.
question: how would you describe what's happening in this video?

Think, pair, share.
Make sure students understand that each triangle is made of smaller identical triangles
---

### Lesson Content
time: 15
Demonstrate Sierpinski triangle in action in netlogo.
live code sierpinski triangle program in netLogo

---

### Lesson Activity
time: 20
Students work in groups. Given modified versions of the Sierpinski
triangle program. Are asked to diagram how the code works.
Once they have a working diagram, display it on butcher paper (nice
  looking, so others can read it).

If time: gallery walk. How is your code similar to/different from other groups? How does that difference show up in the diagrams the other groups drew?
else: move to closing

### Closing
time: 3
if gallery walk happened: What did/didn't make sense to you?
activity probably continue into next lesson.
