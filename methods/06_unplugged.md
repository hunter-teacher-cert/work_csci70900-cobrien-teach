##Partners

##Aim:
introduce students to simple swapping algorithm


##Setup
Set up n chairs in front of classroom. Each chair is numbered 0 to n-1. Have a second chair available.


##activity
the rule: only one student can be out of chair at a time, must move immediately to a different chair.

Make sure students understand the rule

demonstration activity: swap chairs 2 and 3.

Students realize they need another 'temporary' seat.

Break students into n-sized groups.
n students sit in the chairs.

group activity: shift: cycle through so that 0 sits in 1's seat, 1 in 2s, etc.
group challenge: insert a student into list
group challenge: Write an algorithm so that odd numbers end up switched with even numbers
