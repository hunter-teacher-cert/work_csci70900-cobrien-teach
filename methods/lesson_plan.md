## Lesson objective:

### Aim: How do we calculate the fibonacci sequence using a recursive algorithm?

### Warm up
time: 8
 Intro to recursion w/ visual example
 (droste ad, or sierpinski triangle). Ask: What's going on in this picture.
Give students time to answer, pair share, then share out.
introduce vocab item: recursion.
---

### Lesson Content
time: (15 min.)
Review: code for factorials (non-recursive).
Introduce recursive function for factorials.
Discussion question: how can we compare and contrast these two programs (think, pair, share).

Introduce fibonacci sequence:
Discussion Question: Can we program this without recursion?


---

### Lesson Activity
time: (20)
1. students practice predicting the specific terms of the fibonacci sequence
2. Diagram how you find the nth terms
3. Discuss in group: How is your algorithm recursive? How can you program this?
---

### Closing
time: 5 min.
Go through students algorithms.
