# CCG parser for simple English

## Intro
This code implements a parser for a fragment of English ('Simple English') based on combinatory categorial grammars (CCGs).

## The grammar

### What is a grammar?
In linguistics and related fields, a **grammar** refers to a formal theory that can determine whether a string of words is or is not a valid sentence<sup>1</sup> of a given language.

There are a variety of ways to think about grammars, but one way is as a sort of deductive system. In a deductive system like geometry, for example, a small set of axioms, definitions, and rules of logic can be combined to prove theorems true or false. Similarly, in certain kinds of grammars you can combine lexical items and rules (more on these later) to prove that a string is or is not a sentence.

<sup>1. Or in phonological grammar, whether a  sequence of sounds is a valid word of a given language. </sup>
